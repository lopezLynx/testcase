        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Friends</h3>
        <div style="padding:0px 5px 0px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">I literally have only seven friends. My facade resembles that of an unfriendly person (hence my minuscule number of companions). Moreover, I value my mental health, so not everyone can be my friend. To put it simply, I have high standards. </div>
